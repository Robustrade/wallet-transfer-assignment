# Wallet Transfer Assignment Repository

This repository is a reusable coding assignment template for evaluating backend engineers on wallet transfers, idempotency, concurrency control, and double-entry ledger design.

## Included

- `ASSIGNMENT.md` - candidate-facing prompt
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` - required PR structure
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Maven build with unit + integration tests
- `.github/workflows/sonarqube.yml` - SonarQube pull request analysis
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - repository-level Copilot review guidance
- `evaluation_guide.md` - reviewer rubric
- `branch-protection-checklist.md` - GitHub setup checklist

## Intended use

1. Mark this repository as a GitHub template repository.
2. Create one private repository per candidate from the template.
3. Add the candidate as a collaborator.
4. Ask them to submit via a pull request into `main`.
5. Enable required checks, SonarQube, and Copilot review in GitHub.

## Notes

- Copilot automatic pull request review is configured in GitHub repository or organization settings, not purely through files in the repo.
- The `copilot-instructions.md` file included here provides repository-specific review guidance once Copilot review is enabled.
- The CI workflow builds the Java service with `./mvnw clean verify` (unit + integration tests).

## How to Submit Assignment

1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. Complete the assignment described in [`ASSIGNMENT.md`](./ASSIGNMENT.md).
3. **Raise a Pull Request** back to this repository (`main` branch) with your full solution.

Your PR branch should be named: `solution/<your-name>` (e.g., `solution/jane-doe`).

## Local Java skeleton

A Java 17 + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL project skeleton lives in this repo. See [`SETUP.md`](./SETUP.md).
